# About EXT3NK1llr :3
Ext3nk1llr or (extension killer) is a new chrome os exploit that allows you to temporarily disable blocking extensions or "unblock" your Chromebook. This exploit was made by me (vrtz) :3. It uses bookmarks to overload the elected extension with Windows/ requests. This method is completely safe and does not require anything you don't already have. It is very simple. This will lag/crash your computer but will not harm it.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended that you disable v8 optimiser (chrome://settings/content/v8) before using this exploit. It will perform better and reduce crashing. credit to [Blobby-boi](https://github.com/blobby-boi)
# Instructions
**requirements:**
1. chrome://extensions 
2. And bookmarks (not bookmarklets)

**Instructions**
1. Go to chrome://bookmarks and make a new folder. 
2. Then go to chrome://-the extension you want to kill-/
3. Copy the URL of the extension page, then go to  the bookmarks page.
4. Once there, paste the url as  a new bookmark. Make about 800-1000 bookmarks in that folder.
5. Then, open up the extension page for your extension. Keep that open
6. Once done, find the folder and right-click it. Click (open all (number of pages) pages IN NEW WINDOW)
7. Then click open. Wait around a minute. (This will lag your computer.) 
8. Go to the extension page you previously opened and switch the switch to allow file URLs a few times. 
9. Once done, alt-tab and close the window with all the extension pages. Then, search freely. This will last around 5 minutes. The more tabs you add to the folder, the longer it lasts. 
10. If your computer crashes, try fewer bookmarks in the folder. 400-600
11. To revert this, just restart your computer.

# Important
ok, so I just now was told this is almost exactly like LTMEAT extension freeze. I had no clue abt this or that or that even existed. And I'd say all credit for the original exploit goes to them. But I'll still leave this up. Here's the link to that. https://chrose.netlify.app/detail/ltmeat%20flood/
