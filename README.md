# About EXT3NK1llr :3
Ext3nk1llr or (extension killer) is a new chrome os exploit that allows you to temporarily disable blocking extensions or "unblock" your Chromebook. This exploit was made by me (vrtz) :3. It uses bookmarks to overload the elected extension with Windows/ requests. This method is completely safe and does not require anything you don't already have. It is very simple. This will lag/crash your computer but will not harm it.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended that you disable v8 optimiser (chrome://settings/content/v8) before using this exploit. It will perform better and reduce crashing. credit to [Blobby-boi](https://github.com/blobby-boi)
# Instructions
**requirements:**
chrome://extensions
And bookmarks (not bookmarklets)

**Instructions**
Go to chrome://bookmarks and make a new folder.

Then go to chrome://-the extension you want to kill-/

Copy the URL of the extension page, then go to  the bookmarks page.

Once there, paste the url as  a new bookmark. Make about 800-1000 bookmarks in that folder.

Then, open up the extension page for your extension. Keep that open

Once done, find the folder and right-click it. Click (open all (number of pages) pages IN NEW WINDOW)

Then click open. Wait around a minute. (This will lag your computer.) 

Go to the extension page you previously opened and switch the switch to allow file URLs a few times. 

Once done, alt-tab and close the window with all the extension pages. Then, search freely. This will last around 5 minutes. The more tabs you add to the folder, the longer it lasts. 

If your computer crashes, try fewer bookmarks in the folder. 400-600

To revert this, just restart your computer.
